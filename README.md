# :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: VRChat Friends Mover :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside:

This is a way to add all friends of a VRChat account to an another VRChat account :tada:

TODO: Put pictures onto here to explain the usage.

## Notice
### Why do you want to my VRChat user name and the password?

This requires your VRChat user name and the password, but this is used only for access to VRChat API.

Please check ./vrchat-friend-mover.sh if you are careful :+1:

### Does this advocate my account to ban?

Unfortunately, yes.  
Using this script has a **little** possible to advocate ban.  
Please have the risk yourself, sorry.

But **the possible is almost nothing** if you check 'behavior' to 'safe'.  
I strongly recommend to check 'safe'.

TODO: Put the picture of checking 'safe'.

#### Why?

This reason depends the limitation of VRChat API.  
Please see below 2 terms and the page.

> - Do not make queries to the API more than once per 60 seconds.
> - Abuse of the API may result in account termination.
